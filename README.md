For each provider you want to use, gather the following credentials:

#### ImpossibleCloud

  - Create a bucket and generate S3 access keys.
  - Note your: **Access Key ID**, **Secret Access Key**, **Bucket Name**, and **Region**.

#### Wasabi

  - Create a bucket and generate S3 access keys.
  - Note your: **Access Key ID**, **Secret Access Key**, **Bucket Name**, and **Region**.

  - Copy and paste the complete worker code (`multiclouds3 v6.8.js`).
  - Save and deploy.

### 3\. Configure Environment Variables

Go to the Worker's settings → Variables and add the following. You only need to add variables for the providers you are using.

| Optimization | Manual review → Research → Plan | "Optimize my storage" → Actionable plan |

**Time Saved:** Up to **90% faster** for complex tasks!

-----

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **AI Agent**
  - **Agent not responding:** Check AI binding is configured (`[ai]` in wrangler.toml)
  - **Tools not executing:** Verify `enableAgenticAI: true` in CONFIG
  - **Hitting iteration limit:** Increase `maxIterations` or break into smaller tasks
  - **Delete not working:** Check `enableAutoExecution: true` in CONFIG
  - **No duplicates found:** Agent scans up to 5 levels - files may be deeper

### **WebDAV Authentication**
  - **Login fails:** Check username and password in CONFIG match exactly
  - **Session expires:** Credentials stored in sessionStorage (cleared on browser close)
  - **rclone can't connect:** Ensure `authMode: "username"` is set
  - **Still prompts for password:** Clear browser cache and session storage

### **Authentication & Configuration**
  - **Authentication Errors:** Double-check your keys, regions, and bucket names. For R2, ensure `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` is set. For OCI, ensure `OCI_NAMESPACE` is set.
  - **OCI Public Links Not Working:** Direct links for OCI require public bucket. For private buckets, use CDN links.
  - **Delete Failed:** S3 keys need `s3:DeleteObject` permissions.

### **Performance & Caching**
  - **CDN Link Not Fast:** First access fetches from S3. Subsequent accesses are cached and instant.
  - **Large Files Slow with CDN:** Use 🔗 Direct button for files over 1 GB.
  - **Cache Not Working:** Check DevTools → Network → Headers for `CF-Cache-Status: HIT`

### **Global Search & Bulk Operations**
  - **Search Not Working:** Ensure `enableGlobalSearch: true` in CONFIG
  - **Bulk Export Fails:** Check provider credentials and permissions
  - **Presigned URLs Invalid:** Direct links expire after 7 days
