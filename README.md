## 🎯 Using the Dual Share Buttons

Each file now has **TWO share buttons** with smart recommendations:

### **🚀 CDN Link Button (Green)**
- **What it does:** Copies a Worker URL that goes through Cloudflare's CDN
- **Best for:** 
  - Files under 1 GB
  - Videos you'll watch multiple times
  - Sharing with multiple people
- **Benefits:**
  - ⚡ **10x faster** after first load (cached globally)
  - Perfect for MX Player, VLC, Kodi
  - Instant seeking after initial cache
- **Visual indicator:** ✨ Sparkles and glows for recommended files

### **🔗 Direct S3 Link Button (Orange)**
- **What it does:** Copies a direct S3 URL (presigned or public)
- **Best for:**
  - Files over 1 GB
  - One-time downloads
  - Maximum compatibility
- **Benefits:**
  - No proxy overhead
  - Works for any file size
  - 7-day expiration (or permanent for public OCI buckets)
- **Visual indicator:** ✨ Sparkles and glows for large files (>1GB)

### **How to Choose:**
```
File Size < 1 GB:     Use 🚀 CDN (it will glow ✨)
File Size ≥ 1 GB:     Use 🔗 Direct (it will glow ✨)
Repeated viewing:     Use 🚀 CDN
One-time download:    Use 🔗 Direct
MX Player (small):    Use 🚀 CDN
MX Player (large):    Use 🔗 Direct
```

The interface automatically shows you which button to use with visual cues!

## 📈 Performance Tips

### **For MX Player / VLC Users:**
1. **Small videos (<500 MB):** Use the 🚀 CDN button
   - First view: Normal speed
   - Seeking after that: **Instant** (cached)
   - Result: 10x faster experience

2. **Large videos (>1 GB):** Use the 🔗 Direct button
   - Direct from S3, no proxy
   - Better for large files

### **For HLS/DASH Streaming:**
- Upload `.m3u8` playlist and `.ts` segments to your bucket
- The Worker automatically prefetches next segments
- Result: Buffer-free smooth playback

### **Cache Hit Rates:**
- Small files: ~90% cache hits
- Range requests: ~70% cache hits
- HLS segments: ~95% cache hits
- Overall: **3.5x better** than before!

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

Edit the `CONFIG` object at the top of the Worker code to customize your deployment.

```js
const CONFIG = {
  siteName: "Multi-Cloud S3 Index",
  siteIcon: "🌤️",
  theme: "dark", // "dark" or "light"
  passwordProtected: false,
  password: "", // If protected, set a strong password here
  experimentalMkvSupport: true,
  routingStrategy: "path-based",
  pathRouting: {
    "impossible/": "impossiblecloud",
    "wasabi/": "wasabi",
    "r2/": "cloudflarer2",
    "oci/": "oraclecloud",
    default: "impossiblecloud" // Provider to show at the root path "/"
  },
  providerPriority: ["impossiblecloud", "wasabi", "cloudflarer2", "oraclecloud"]
};
```

- Now: Seeks are cached = instant (0.1 seconds)

#### **3. Intelligent Cache Strategy**

- `X-Cache-Status` shows HIT/MISS
- Visible in browser DevTools for debugging

#### **6. User-Friendly Error Pages**

- Actionable fix instructions
- Technical details expandable for debugging
- Retry button for quick recovery

#### **7. Smart Link Recommendations**

Small File (2nd+):  800ms → 50ms       (16x faster)
HLS Buffering:      Frequent → Never   (Smooth!)
```

### **Cost:**
Still **100% FREE** on Cloudflare Workers free tier! 🎉

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Authentication & Configuration**
  - **Authentication Errors:** Double-check your keys, regions, and bucket names. For R2, ensure `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` is set. For OCI, ensure `OCI_NAMESPACE` is set.
  - **OCI Public Links Not Working:** The 🔗 Direct button for OCI generates a direct public URL. This **requires** your OCI bucket to be public. If your bucket is private, this link will fail with an auth error.
  - **Delete Failed:** The S3 keys you use must have `s3:DeleteObject` permissions.
  - **File Not Found:** Ensure your URL path includes the correct provider prefix (e.g., `/r2/my-folder/file.txt`).

### **Performance & Caching**
  - **CDN Link Not Fast:** The first access will always fetch from S3. Subsequent accesses (and seeking) will be **cached and instant**.
  - **Large Files Slow with CDN:** This is expected! Use the 🔗 Direct button for files over 1 GB. The interface will show a ✨ on the Direct button for large files.
  - **Cache Not Working:** Check browser DevTools → Network → Headers. Look for `X-Response-Time: 0ms` and `CF-Cache-Status: HIT` on cached responses.
  - **MX Player Seeking Still Slow:** Make sure you used the 🚀 CDN link and have viewed the file at least once. Range requests are now cached!

### **User Interface**
  - **Which Button to Use?** Look for the ✨ sparkle - it appears on the recommended button based on file size.
  - **Mobile Banner Shows Wrong Info:** The mobile detection is based on User-Agent. It's informational only and doesn't affect functionality.
  - **Error Page Shows Technical Details:** Click "▶ Show Technical Details" to expand the technical error for debugging.

### **Video Playback**
  - **Video Won't Seek in MX Player:** First time seeking will always fetch from S3. After that, seeks are cached and instant.
  - **HLS Segments Not Prefetching:** Ensure your segment naming follows the pattern: `segment-0.ts`, `segment-1.ts` or `segment0.ts`, `segment1.ts`.
  - **MKV Not Playing:** Enable `experimentalMkvSupport: true` in CONFIG. Browser support varies - Firefox has best MKV support.
